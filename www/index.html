<h1>rPython R package</h1>

<p>This package allows the user to call <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> from R. It is a natural extension of the <a href="http://rjython.r-forge.r-project.org/">rJython</a> package by the same author.

<h3>What can be done with it?</h3>

<p>rPython is intended for running Python code from R. R programs and packages can:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Pass data to Python: vectors of various types (logical, character, numeric,...), lists, etc.</li>
	<li>Get data from Python.</li>
	<li>Call Python code, call Python functions and methods.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is a sample session with rPython:</p>

<pre><code>
python.call( "len", 1:3 )
a <- 1:4
b <- 5:8
python.exec( "def concat(a,b): return a+b" )
python.call( "concat", a, b)

python.assign( "a",  "hola hola" )
python.method.call( "a", "split", " " )
</code></pre>

<h3>Who may be interested in it?</h3>

<p>Mainly, users and package developers who want to use functionalities available in Python but not in R.</p> 

<p>There are many modules in Python which could easily extend R functionality if there would be a way to call Python code from R. </p> 

<h3>How does this package relate to rpy and rpy2?</h3>

<p><a href="http://rpy.sourceforge.net/">rpy</a> and <a href="http://rpy.sourceforge.net/rpy2">rpy2</a>, a redesign and rewrite of rpy, are Python interfaces to R. They allow users to call R from Python.</p>

<p>rPython provides the opposite interface.</p> 

<p>Besides, no code from rpy/rpy2 has been used in the development of rPython.</p> 

<h3>How does rPython work?</h3>

<p>One of the most daunting tasks in building an interface between two languages is provide mechanisms for exchanging different data structures between them. rPython uses <a href="http://www.json.org">json</a>:
<ol>
	<li>R/Python objects are dumped into json strings using their respective parsers (<a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RJSONIO/index.html">RJSONIO</a> and <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/simplejson/">simplejson</a>) respectively.</li>
	<li>These strings are passed between the two languages using their string exchange mechanisms.</li>
	<li>json strings are finally reconstructed into language objects on the other side.</li>
</ol>

<p>This simple mechanism allow R and Python exchange relatively complex data structures with ease.</p> 

<h3>Installation</h3>

<p>The package can be installed via</p>

<code>install.packages("rPython", repos = "http://www.datanalytics.com/R") </code>

<p>as source package. This approach should work on Linux and other UNIX-like platforms, such as Mac, but would fail on Windows.
In fact, so far, the author has been unable to find a reliable way to locate the required Python files on a Windows platform.</p>

<p>Help in this regard would be highly appreciated.</p>


<h3>Further info</h3>

<p>The project summary page can be found <a href="http://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/rpython/">here</a>. 

<p>The package has been developed by <a href="http://www.datanalytics.com">Carlos J. Gil Bellosta</a> and is based on a previous package, <a href="http://rjython.r-forge.r-project.org/">rJython</a>, by the same author together with G. Grothendieck.</p>
